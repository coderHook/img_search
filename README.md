<h1>Image Search Abstraction Layer</h1>

    - The objective for this challenge is to create a server that provides with the lins to the images we search.
    - Additionally we can check in what page on the search we want to extract the file.
    - Also, We will have a path to check for the most popular searchs, in our database.
    

For this challenge we are going to use:

    - After a qucick research I decided to use this API REST called: Bing Search API for NodeJS
      It seems that fits this project completely, and has a good number of free search per month (bing).
